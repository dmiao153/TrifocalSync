# TrifocalSync
This is the supplementary code to the NeurIPS 2024 paper "Tensor-based Synchronization and the Low Rankness of the Block Trifocal Tensor".
Due to licensing issues, we don't provide all the data and external packages here. Please contact miao0022@umn.edu for details or questions regarding the code. 
The main synchronization function and the estimation pipeline for trifocal tensors can be found in the code by tracking the main script for running the experiments, EPFL_run_pipeline.m function. 

The code also relies on a few external packages, including CVX, [FCC](https://github.com/yunpeng-shi/FCC), [MatchFAME](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/papers/Li_Fast_Accurate_and_Memory-Efficient_Partial_Permutation_Synchronization_CVPR_2022_paper.pdf), [NRFM](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~ronisen/SfM_CVPR2017_code.zip), [STE](https://github.com/alexfengg/STE), [tensorlab](https://www.tensorlab.net/), [TFT_vs_Fund](https://github.com/LauraFJulia/TFT_vs_Fund), and the classical vgg 3D computer vision code. For details, please contact Daniel Miao if help is needed to run the code.
