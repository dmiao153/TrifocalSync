# TrifocalSync
This is the supplementary code to the NeurIPS 2024 paper "Tensor-based Synchronization and the Low Rankness of the Block Trifocal Tensor".
Due to licensing issues, we will upload the code at a slightly later date. 

Please contact miao0022@umn.edu for details or questions regarding the code. 


The main code to rerun some of the experiments would be the EPFL_run_pipeline.m function. However, the data is not provided in the code. The data is from the Strecha dataset. The code also relies on a few external packages, including CVX, [FCC](https://github.com/yunpeng-shi/FCC), [MatchFAME](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/papers/Li_Fast_Accurate_and_Memory-Efficient_Partial_Permutation_Synchronization_CVPR_2022_paper.pdf), [NRFM](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~ronisen/SfM_CVPR2017_code.zip), [STE](https://github.com/alexfengg/STE), [tensorlab](https://www.tensorlab.net/), [TFT_vs_Fund](https://github.com/LauraFJulia/TFT_vs_Fund), and the classical vgg 3D computer vision code. For details, please contact Daniel Miao if help is needed to run the code.
